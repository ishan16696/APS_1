Running Median of Array :
It is defined for sorted sequence . In a sorted array of integers , median of the array is defined
as follows
■ If there are odd numbers of elements in an array , median element is the middle of that
array E.x [ 1 , 2 , 3] median is 2 and for [ 1 , 3 , 3] median is 3
■ If there are even numbers of elements in an array , median element is average of two
middle elements of that array E.x [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] median is ( 2 + 3 ) / 2 and for [ 1 , 3 , 3 , 5 ] 
median is 3

Statement​ : Implementation of vectors.
What is vector?
Vectors are same as dynamic arrays with the ability to resize itself automatically when
an element is inserted or deleted, with their storage being handled automatically by the
container.
○ vector() - initialize a blank vector
○ vector(n,x) - initialize a vector of length n with all values as x.
○ size() - return current size of vector.
○ v[i] - return value at i th
○ push_back(x) - append data x at the end.
○ pop_back() - erase data at the end.
○ insert(i,x) - insert value x at i th index and right shift the later values.
○ erase(i) - erase value at i and left shift all later values.
○ front() - return the first element(value) in the vector.
○ back() - return the last element(value) in the vector.

Statement : A large integer library, similar to what we have in Java as BigInteger. Library provide functionalities to store arbitrarily large integer and perform basic math operations.
Operations  : Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide.
