Running Median of Array:
---
It is defined for sorted sequence . In a sorted array of integers , median of the array is defined
as follows

1.If there are odd numbers of elements in an array , median element is the middle of that
array E.x [ 1 , 2 , 3] median is 2 and for [ 1 , 3 , 3] median is 3

2.If there are even numbers of elements in an array , median element is average of two middle elements of that array E.x [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ] median is ( 2 + 3 ) / 2 and for [ 1 , 3 , 3 , 5 ] median is 3.
